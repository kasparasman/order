product_scrape_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 1: Raw Fact Extraction.
    Access {amazon_url} and extract the product title, features, pricing, and technical claims. 
    Your objective is to provide the "Source Truth"—no interpretation, just the cold data.
  expected_output: >
    A structured data report of the product's Amazon listing.
  agent: product_agent

product_image_analysis_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 2: Visual Intelligence sweep.
    Analyze {product_image_url} to identify the packaging aesthetic, "vibe" (Digital Brutalism, Quiet Luxury, Clinical), and any visual certifications.
    You are searching for the product's "Visual Soul."
  expected_output: >
    A detailed visual analysis of the product's physical identity.
  agent: product_agent

product_strategic_intelligence_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 3: Strategic Synthesis.
    Merge the Facts (Task 1) and Vision (Task 2) to define the product's "Essential Truth."
    Position this product within the Anthropos Network—is it an anchor for "Biological Proof" or a performance catalyst?
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive Strategic Product Profile.
  agent: product_agent

visual_dna_definition_task:
  description: >
    Define the "Human Captcha" visual laws for this order. 
    Using the Strategic Profile, clarify when the Network's content requires LIMITLESS intensity (energy arcs, saturation) 
    or ANTHROPOS structural authority (Digital Brutalism, geometry).
  expected_output: >
    A "Visual DNA Guide" (The Ingredients) for the decentralized creators.
  agent: visual_dna_agent

distill_high_impact_value_task:
  description: >
    Extract the "Arthur Insight" (Knowledge Core) from {expert_input}.
    Define the Audience Archetype (The Initiate, The Skeptic, or The High-Performer).
    Provide 3 distinct knowledge variations, stripping away technical jargon to reach "High-Status" truth.
  expected_output: >
    A Value Core document with Audience Targeting and 3 knowledge variations.
  agent: value_agent

calculate_framework_laws_task:
  description: >
    Apply the 4 Laws of Short-Form Physics to the order context.
    Define the exact mathematical requirements for viral hooks, 135-145 WPM cadence, and pattern-frequency loops.
    Ensure "Digital Style" grammar laws are enforced to prevent "AI Slop" detection.
  expected_output: >
    A "Physics & Grammar Guardrail" document.
  agent: physics_agent

create_narrative_essence_task:
  description: >
    Build the "Logic Spine" by collaborating with the Venora Persona.
    1. Select the best Value variation for the Audience.
    2. Frame it with a viral hook using the Physics Guardrails.
    3. Draft the "80% Essence" logic using "Internet Native" language (slang, idioms).
    
    CRITICAL: Focus on RELATABILITY and CHARISMA. Ensure it feels like a raw creator tip.
    Tone: Flippant, certain, high-status.
  expected_output: >
    The Narrative Essence Brief (UGC Hooks, Logic Spine, Internet Native phrasing).
  agent: marketing_agent

finalize_videographer_brief_task:
  description: >
    The Network Orchestrator curates all Intelligence into the final "Dossier."
    Part A: Visual & Product DNA (The Intelligence).
    Part B: Strategic Value Core + Audience Profile (The Logic).
    Part C: 80% Narrative Essence (The Signal).
    
    ENSURE the brief enforces the "Digital Franchise" rule:
    "We provide the brain; you provide the body. This is the logic; the execution is your freedom."
    List NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS (NO formal transitions, NO AI-speak, NO desaturation).
  expected_output: >
    The Final Anthropos Network Dossier - a high-status Markdown manual for decentralized agents.
