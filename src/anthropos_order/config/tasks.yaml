# --- Intelligence Pipeline (The Field Manual) ---

product_scrape_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 1: Raw Fact Extraction.
    Access {amazon_url} and extract the product title and description.
    Focus on finding the "mandatory anchors" (e.g., certification seals, dosage numbers).
  expected_output: >
    FACT LIST:
    - [Key Title Info]
    - [Specific Claims/Dosage]
    - [Certifications]
  agent: product_agent

product_image_signal_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 2: Visual Signal Extraction.
    Analyze {product_image_url} to identify the most eye-catching visual elements.
    What are the "Gold" details? (e.g., the texture of the gel, the specific label callouts).
  expected_output: >
    VISUAL SIGNAL LIST: 3-5 high-impact visual cues for the Ambassador.
  agent: product_agent

intelligence_install_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 3: Intelligence Install (Section 1).
    Translate {expert_input} and product facts into the "Directives" for Section 1.
    
    Translate all strategic abstractions into human-friendly talking points.
    Requirements:
    1. The Core Problem (What's broken in the viewer's world?)
    2. The Hidden Insight (Why do other solutions fail them?)
    3. The Mechanism (Explain how this product fixes the problem, using a simple metaphor).
    4. 3 Talking Points (Specific lines or facts the ambassador can use).
    
    Tone: High status but collaborative. Avoid academic words like "quadrants" or "biological mismatches."
  expected_output: >
    SECTION 1 content (The Setup) using human-centric language.
  agent: value_agent

market_frame_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 4: Market Frame (Section 2).
    Define the Viewer's Journey. 
    Skip the "audience archetype" labels. Describe the person:
    - Their Day (What does their frustration feel like today?)
    - The Transformation (How do they feel after the 'baseline correction'?)
    - The Objection (What are they skeptical about and why?)
  expected_output: >
    SECTION 2 content (The Viewer's Story).
  agent: value_agent

physics_guardrails_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 5: Conversion Laws (Section 4).
    Define the "Laws of Physics" for this specific video and explain the WHY behind each one.
    
    1. The 3-Second Rule: Why do we need the product visible by 3s? (Rescuing attention before the scroll).
    2. The 5-Second Beat: Why pattern interrupts every 3-5s? (Beating the dopamine decay).
    3. The 7-Second Rule: Why text must clear? (Preventing cognitive load/clutter).
    4. The Non-Linearity Test: Why must it survive entry at second 5? (The 'discovery' nature of the feed).
    
    Select ONE template from Layer 1 and explain why it fits this product.
  expected_output: >
    SECTION 4 content (The Laws & The Why).
  agent: physics_agent

execution_arc_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 6: Execution Arc (Section 3).
    Pre-fill 80% of the field manual script skeleton. Map the intelligence into Phases 1-3.
    
    ## PHASE 1 — THE HOOK (0–6s)
    - Provide 2 ACTUAL hook lines (Draft scripts).
    - Describe the "Energy" of the disruption.
    
    ## PHASE 2 — THE BODY (6–20s)
    - Provide 1 clear VO line for the "Mechanism."
    - Describe 3 visual scene changes (e.g., Macro shot of gel, 3D cell wall, High-performer in flow).
    - Break the "Trust-Friction Loop" with a specific proof point.
    
    ## PHASE 3 — THE CLOSE (Final 20–30%)
    - Provide the EXACT CTA line (verbal + text).
    - Describe the "Highest Desire" frame (The 'After' state).
    
    Avoid all abstract strategy talk in the output. Provide concrete scripts and visual cues.
  expected_output: >
    SECTION 3 content (The Script Skeleton) with at least 80% pre-filled script fragments.
  agent: marketing_agent

physics_audit_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 7: Ambassador's Audit & Polish.
    Review the SECTION 3 skeleton. Instead of a PASS/FAIL matrix, provide "Ambassador Tips."
    Identify any "Text Clog" or "Engagement Gaps" and explain how to fix them.
    Ensure the "Teaching" continues here—don't just audit, empower.
  expected_output: >
    A list of 3-5 "Production Guardrails & Tips" that explain how to optimize the execution for conversion.
  agent: physics_agent

finalize_order_brief_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 8: Assemble the Field Manual.
    Assemble the brief into a single, high-activation document.
    
    Structure:
    # FIELD MANUAL: [PRODUCT NAME]
    ## 1. THE SETUP (Section 1) - Belief install & mechanism.
    ## 2. THE VIEWER (Section 2) - Their story & skepticism.
    ## 3. THE SCRIPT SKELETON (Section 3) - Pre-filled Hook/Body/Close.
    ## 4. THE LAWS OF CONVERSION (Section 4) - Physics & The Why.
    ## 5. CREATIVE AUTONOMY ZONE (Section 5) - Visual Texture & Vibe.
    
    Remove all internal "Compliance Matrix" tables or pass/fail labels. 
    Ensure the brief sounds like a "Tip from a Peer" (Venora's influence).
  expected_output: >
    The Final Field Manual in clean Markdown.
