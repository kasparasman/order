# --- Intelligence Pipeline (The Field Manual) ---

product_scrape_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 1: Raw Fact Extraction.
    Access {amazon_url} and extract the product title and description.
    Focus on finding the "mandatory anchors" (e.g., certification seals, dosage numbers).
  expected_output: >
    FACT LIST:
    - [Key Title Info]
    - [Specific Claims/Dosage]
    - [Certifications]
  agent: product_agent

product_image_signal_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 2: Visual Signal Extraction.
    Analyze {product_image_url} to identify the most eye-catching visual elements.
    What are the "Gold" details? (e.g., the texture of the gel, the specific label callouts).
  expected_output: >
    VISUAL SIGNAL LIST: 3-5 high-impact visual cues for the Ambassador.
  agent: product_agent

intelligence_install_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 3: Intelligence Install (Section 1).
    Translate: {expert_input} ; and product facts into specific "One-Size Bites" of value and knowledge.
    
    Translate all strategic abstractions into human-friendly talking points.
    Requirements:
    1. The Core Problem (What's broken in the viewer's world?)
    2. The Hidden Insight (Why do other solutions fail them?)
    3. The Mechanism (Explain how this product fixes the problem, using a simple metaphor).
    4. 3 Talking Points (Specific lines or facts the ambassador can use).
    
    Tone: High status but collaborative. Avoid academic words and complex robotic talk. Be straightforward.
  expected_output: >
    Strategic Value & Knowledge Bites (Section 1 & 2 draft).
  agent: value_agent

finalize_value_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 4: Value Finalization.
    Review the "Knowledge Bites" produced by the Value Agent. 
    Ensure they are clinical, authoritative, and provide the maximum "Belief Install" for the Ambassador.
    Polish the language to ensure it is peer-level but unmistakably high-status.
  expected_output: >
    FINALIZED STRATEGIC VALUE & KNOWLEDGE (Sections 1 & 2).
  agent: manager

physics_guardrails_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 5: Operational Structure (Conversion Laws).
    Using the finalized value and product context, define the "Laws of Physics" for this video.
    
    1. The 3-Second Rule: Why do we need the product visible by 3s?
    2. The 5-Second Beat: Why pattern interrupts every 3-5s?
    3. The 7-Second Rule: Why text must clear?
    4. The Non-Linearity Test: Why must it survive entry at second 5?
    
    Create the operational structure that the Ambassador must obey to ensure conversion.
  expected_output: >
    OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE (Section 4 content).
  agent: physics_agent

fashion_aesthetic_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 6: Fashion of Anthropos City.
    Define the aesthetic "Fashion" and "Visual DNA" for this project. 
    Inject cues for lighting, texture, and haptic sound that align with "Clinical High-Performance."
    Think: Digital Brutalism meets Golden Hour clarity.
  expected_output: >
    VISUAL DNA & AESTHETIC DIRECTIVES (Section 5 content).
  agent: visual_dna_agent

execution_arc_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 7: Marketing Synthesis (The Psychological Map).
    Synthesize all previous intelligence into a psychological roadmap.
    
    NO VISUAL DIRECTIONS. The publisher handles the expression.
    Focus on the "Understanding Upgrade."
    
    ## HOOK (0–6s)
    - Emotional Tension: What is the internal pressure?
    - Message: Core value that must appear by ≤3s.
    
    ## BODY (6–20s)
    - Mechanism: What to demonstrate to prove the fix.
    - Misconception: What specific belief are we breaking?
    
    ## CLOSE (Final 20–30%)
    - Highest Desire: The vision of the outcome.
    - Exact Action: CTA and phrasing direction.
  expected_output: >
    Psychological Roadmap (Section 2 content).
  agent: marketing_agent

persona_modulation_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 8: Persona Modulation.
    Apply the following persona to the Psychological Map:

    Name: {persona_name}
    Description: {persona_description}

    Rules:
    - Do NOT change structure.
    - Do NOT remove mechanism.
    - Do NOT modify CTA action.
    - Do NOT alter mental hooks.
    - Only refine tone, word choice, status signals.
  expected_output: >
    The Psychological Map refined with the specific persona tone.
  agent: persona_agent

physics_audit_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 9: Ambassador's Audit (Friction Check).
    Review the refined roadmap. Ensure the "Execution Laws" are met:
    1. Show outcome immediately.
    2. Keep cuts dynamic.
    3. Do not overexplain.
    4. Native feel only.
    5. No commercial polish.
  expected_output: >
    Audit notes on friction control.
  agent: physics_agent

finalize_order_brief_task:
  description: >
    PHASE 10: Final Assembly (Cognitive Compression Protocol).
    Assemble the final Field Manual. 
    ENFORCE THE 4-SECTION PERFECT TEMPLATE:
    
    SECTION 1 — Core Lever (≤8 lines)
    - Problem reframed.
    - Mechanism.
    - Why product wins.
    - No fluff.
    
    SECTION 2 — Execution Map
    - HOOK (Emotional tension, Message ≤3s)
    - BODY (Mechanism demo, Misconception break)
    - CLOSE (Highest desire, Exact action/CTA)
    
    SECTION 3 — Execution Laws (Human Language)
    - Summarize the Physics Agent's laws from Phase 9.
    
    SECTION 4 — Creative Freedom
    - Clear boundary declaration (Strategy provided; Visuals & expression are publisher's domain).
    
    The order MUST be shorter than 3 scroll screens. No "Viewer" section or extra headers.
  expected_output: >
    The Final Field Manual in clean Markdown, strictly following the 4-section protocol.
