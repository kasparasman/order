# Anthropos Network Testing Flow Nr. 2: Omega-3 Heuristic Pilot (20-Second Hard Cap)

## 1. Operating Principle: The 20-Second Cap (Low Entropy)
Following the Execution Laws, this video is strictly constrained to 20 seconds. 


Research part - ideation before script
What could be the knowledge upgrade here?
Core idea - brain fog, 
why?
Because brain power is one of the most important and valued creative tools people have, and most people have it and it stops most people - so therefore mass marketing potential

The Single Value: Cognitive Clarity (Mental "Sharpness").
The Single Mechanism: "The Brain is 60% Fat."
The Single Cause/Effect: Low Omega-3 = "Dry" Brain/Slow Signals → High Nordic Omega-3 = "Lubricated" Neurons/Fast Processing.

new directive update: use the become insanely smart, rather then just fix your brain fog
high potential state powered by nordic fuel
"Pull the many, don't chase the few." - make it a solution to become next level person to anyone with a brain, not just high performers or anyone like that.


This is what 100% brain processing speed feels like
The Mechanism (Physics): "Your brain is 60% fat; it literally runs on the quality of oil you give it."
The Closer (Inertia): "Nordic Freshness = No Fog. Look for the Blue Bottle."


Objection we need to counter:
In 2026, the biggest barrier to Omega-3 sales is oxidation (rancid oil that causes "fishy burps"). - towards the end obviously

## 2. Raw Script (For Teleprompter/Execution)
*Strictly capped to under 46 words for a 20-second runtime constraint. High retention, loop-open structure.*

Your brain is 60% fat. But 9 out of 10 Americans starve it with junk, so it runs like *this*.

But if you pour in premium fuel...(omega 3) it unlocks 100% performance.  

And I am the highest-performance brain fuel in the world. Buy me at AnthroposCity.com/shop.

## 3. The Final Shot Map & Generation Prompts

My raw scene description:
first we start with the measuring brain-shaped cylinder, 60% of it is fat, then we show image overlay of 9/10 americans, then we show engine. Then we switch to high quality chrome engine while talking and pouring, with morph and camera shift pan transition between scenes and walking of the persona, we show teh engine, then transition to podium scene and lastly the shop scene. 

### 🎬 Scene 1: The Brutal Truth (0-8s)
**Audio:** *"Your brain is 60% fat. But 9 out of 10 Americans starve it with junk, so it runs like *this*."*

*   **Nano Banana Starting Image Prompt:** `[Use Persona Ref] The anthropomorphized supplement bottle main character standing in a clean, scientific laboratory setting next to a large, clear glass measuring cylinder that is uniquely shaped like a human brain. Inside the brain-cylinder, exactly 60% of the volume is filled with thick, visible, rich yellow fat. He points factually towards the 60% measurement line with an authoritative, educational expression. | Authentic UGC style, raw footage but clinical and precise. | Bright, sterile laboratory lighting, photorealistic 8k.`
*   **Veo 3.1 Video Prompt:** `The scene starts on the bottle persona pointing at the 60% fat line in the brain-shaped measuring cylinder. At the audio cue "9 out of 10 Americans", an image overlay/flash-cut appears showing a stark photograph of exhausted, miserable, brain-fogged Americans. The scene then violently snap-cuts to a dark, heavy environment where the bottle persona is now pouring grey, disgusting fast-food sludge into a rusted F1 engine block shaped like a brain. The engine sputters, farts, and rapidly rusts out into a dilapidated bucket as the bottle persona looks on with concern. | Clean scientific start transitioning to gritty cinematic physics with a B-Roll flash-cut. | Hyperrealistic 8k.`

### 🎬 Scene 2: The 100% Upgrade (8-14s)
**Audio:** *"But if you pour in premium fuel...(omega 3) it unlocks 100% performance."*

*   **Nano Banana Starting Image Prompt:** `[Use Persona Ref] The positive anthropomorphized premium Omega-3 supplement bottle main character walking intelligently next to a gleaming, pristine chrome F1 race car engine, where the engine block is shaped exactly like a human brain. He is pouring glowing, golden Omega-3 pills directly into the top of it while in motion. A high-tech IQ/intelligence meter designed like a car speedometer is visibly maxed out at redline RPM. | Authentic UGC tracking shot style, dynamic movement. | Bright vibrant colours, cinematic studio lighting, photorealistic 8k.`
*   **Veo 3.1 Video Prompt:** `The dark, rusted engine scene morphs seamlessly into a vibrant, high-energy environment via a fluid camera shift pan. The anthropomorphized bottle persona is now walking smoothly beside the pristine chrome F1 brain-engine, pouring glowing golden Omega-3 pills into it as he moves. Instantly, the engine revs hard, shaking with immense power, and flawless blue flames shoot out of the exhaust. The bottle persona continues walking with total confidence and looks at the camera. | Fluid dynamic camera pan morph transition, continuous tracking shot. | Sharp lighting transition to glowing blue/gold/chrome. Hyperrealistic 8k.`

### 🎬 Scene 3: The Podium Upgrade (14-20s)
**Audio:** *"And I am the highest-performance brain fuel in the world. Buy me at AnthroposCity.com/shop."*

*   **Nano Banana Image Prompt:** `[Use Persona Ref] A gleaming, highly reflective Formula 1 winner's podium with three steps (1st, 2nd, 3rd) in a premium, high-tech stadium environment. The positive anthropomorphized premium Omega-3 supplement bottle main character is sitting proudly on the 1st place top tier, holding himself like a grand champion trophy, radiating vibrant golden and cyan light. On the lower 2nd and 3rd place tiers sit two sad, dull, generic fish-oil pill balls looking defeated in the shadows. | Cinematic medium-wide shot, heroic low angle, authentic UGC style. | Bright vibrant colours, stadium spotlights, photorealistic 8k.`
*   **Veo 3.1 Video Prompt:** `The scene transitions from the engine. The anthropomorphized bottle persona is now sitting proudly like a champion trophy on the 1st place tier of an F1 winner's podium. The two generic, dull supplement balls on the lower tiers look completely defeated and sad. The camera performs a dramatic Dolly Zoom (Vertigo effect)—simultaneously dollying backward perfectly while zooming in—keeping the victorious bottle perfectly framed in the center as the stadium background dynamically warps and shifts around him. The lighting is explosive, with flashing stadium strobes and a cinematic hero glow. He looks directly at the camera with absolute authority while speaking the final CTA. | Intense cinematic Dolly Zoom / Vertigo camera movement. | Sharp dynamic lighting, hyperrealistic 8k.`




Brain sludge last prompt:
A hyper-realistic, cinematic, continuous, and steady close-up camera shot from a new angle focusing on an anthropomorphized premium Omega-3 supplement bottle character with arms and an expressive face. Thhe bottle persona character actively pours thick, grey, disgusting fast-food sludge from a greasy fryer basket directly into the top intake manifold of the gleaming chrome brain-engine. The very moment the sludge hits the intake, the engine violently sputters, visibly chokes, and rapidly morphs, instantly corroding, losing its shine, and rusting completely over in seconds to transform into a decrepit, smoking, old rust bucket brain shaped engine that spits out a pathetic puff of thick dark exhaust.

veo prompt: 
`A highly realistic continuous shot in a clean, sterile scientific laboratory. The anthropomorphized premium Omega-3 supplement bottle character stands next to a large, clear glass shaped exactly like a human brain. The character looks directly at the camera with a positive, educational expression while actively pouring thick, rich golden yellow fat from a beaker into the brain glass, filling it up. He says this line in a fast tiktok hook pace: "Your brain is 60% fat. But 9 out of 10 Americans starve it with junk, so it runs like this...". Cinematic depth of field, realistic liquid fluid simulation. | Bright, sterile laboratory lighting, hyperrealistic 8k.`
