# Anthropos Network Testing Flow Nr. 1: Omega-3 Heuristic Pilot
*Designed for aNet Publisher Execution (Heuristic First Iteration)*

## 1. Operating Principle: Heuristic Validation First
* **The Law of Empirical Validation (1.1)**: "Internal opinions are mere hypotheses; customer behavior is the only valid experiment result." 
* **The Law of Validation Precedence (1.5)**: Before we formalize a perfect agentic workflow, we must run a small-scale, human-led simulation.
* **The Goal**: This is a heuristic test. You (the publisher) will build the video organically using the parameters below. We will log the results, identify the breaking points, and *then* map the successful elements back to the rigid `logic.md` agentic frameworks.

## 2. The Narrative Angle (The 3 Pillar Upgrade)

* **The Core Thesis**: "If you start taking Me (Omega-3), these 3 specific things will happen to your body."
* **The Educated Mechanism**: You are explaining that Omega-3 works by fixing "slow" cells. This is a structural upgrade, not a generic "boost".

### The 3 Touchpoints to Hit:
1.  **Inflammation Check:** The low-grade stiffness/puffiness goes down.
2.  **Energy Baseline Fix:** General low energy stabilizes (because cells are communicating properly).
3.  **Hormone Balance:** Internal biological systems regulate.

## 3. The Functional Script Guide (Organic Flow)

*You do not need to follow this word-for-word. This is the structural map for your organic creation.*

### A. The Hook: The Timeline
*   **Goal**: Invite them into a 30-day biological timeline.
*   **Vibe**: "Here are the top 3 things that happen to you when you start taking me."

### B. The Body: The 3 Pillars + Educational Pivot
*   **Goal**: List Inflammation, Energy, and Hormones, but inject the "Smart Mechanism" so it doesn't sound generic.
*   **The Smart Mechanism (The "Why")**: Explain briefly that cells can get "slow" and rigid. Omega-3 makes the cell walls fluid again so your body can actually perform its daily functions.

### C. The CTA: The Check
*   **Goal**: Drive them to verify the quality.
*   **Vibe**: "Check the label for high EPA/DHA. Take a look here."

## 4. Required Publisher Output & Logging
*Since the goal is to formalize this into an agentic workflow later, we must log your manual process.*

**After creation, the publisher must log the following:**
1.  **Time to Create**: How long did it take to move from this document to a finished video?
2.  **Creative Friction**: Which part of this prompt was hardest to visually execute?
3.  **Hook Variations**: Did you record multiple hooks? If so, list them.
4.  **Length**: Final video duration (aiming for under 45 seconds).
