# Anthropos Network Testing Flow Nr. 1: Omega-3 Heuristic Pilot
*Designed for aNet Publisher Execution (Heuristic First Iteration)*

## 1. Operating Principle: Heuristic Validation First
* **The Law of Empirical Validation (1.1)**: "Internal opinions are mere hypotheses; customer behavior is the only valid experiment result." 
* **The Law of Validation Precedence (1.5)**: Before we formalize a perfect agentic workflow, we must run a small-scale, human-led simulation.
* **The Goal**: This is a heuristic test. You (the publisher) will build the video organically using the parameters below. We will log the results, identify the breaking points, and *then* map the successful elements back to the rigid `logic.md` agentic frameworks.

## 2. Word Count Constraints (The Physics of Pacing)
*To prevent cognitive overload and maintain the correct persona stance, we must strictly adhere to verified word counts for short-form pacing.*

*   **Slow & Emotive (60 words)**: Best for building trust or explaining complex ideas.
*   **Medium & Conversational (75 words)**: *The "Golden Rule"* for standard explainer videos or casual social content. **(We are targeting this for our Pilot).**
*   **Fast & Energetic (80–85 words)**: Ideal for high-energy ads or hard sells (Do not use this for the Bottle Persona).

## 3. The Narrative Angle (The Single Deep-Dive)
*   **The Strategic Pivot**: Instead of listing 3 generic benefits (which triggers "listicle reactance" and analysis paralysis), we are going deep on ONE profound biological mechanism.
*   **The Core Thesis**: "If you start taking Me (Omega-3), one massive biological shift dictates everything else: your cells speed up."
*   **The Educated Mechanism**: You are explaining that Omega-3 works by fixing "slow," rigid cells. This is a structural upgrade, not a generic "boost".

## 4. The "Mechanism-to-Benefit" Causal Chain (Script Structure)
*Use this logical architecture to build out the body of your script. It maps the journey from a microscopic mechanism to a macroscopic daily benefit.*

**1. The Hook (Curiosity & Promise)**
*   *Function:* Interrupt the scroll and set an open loop.
*   *Publisher Data:* "I make up 40% of your brain and here's what I'd do to you if you tried me:"

**2. The Micro-Action (The Biological Mechanism)**
*   *Function:* Establish authority. Explain *how* it works at the smallest level.
*   *Publisher Data:* "First I would go down to your cells and make them wet and fluid."

**3. The Immediate Knock-On Effect (The Translation)**
*   *Function:* Translate the biology into a physical reality. What does "wet cells" actually mean for the body?
*   *Publisher Data:* "This would make your thinking feel easier and more smooth."
*   *Placeholder to Fill:* (Add 1-2 sentences expanding on how signals move faster between fluid cells, removing the feeling of being "stuck" or "foggy").

**4. The Macro-Outcome (The Reversal of the Pain Point)**
*   *Function:* The aspirational payout. What is the ultimate, daily benefit they care about?
*   *Placeholder to Fill:* (Connect the smooth thinking to the reversal of their afternoon crash or general low energy. E.g., "Which means that heavy 3 PM brain fog vanishes, and your energy stays perfectly stable.")

**5. The Qualifier/Moat (The Heuristic Trap)**
*   *Function:* Stop them from buying a generic brand. Introduce the condition for success.
*   *Placeholder to Fill:* (Introduce the rule. E.g., "But this biological trick only works if the EPA and DHA numbers are high enough to trigger the effect. Cheap oils won't do it.")

**6. The CTA (Direct Instruction)**
*   *Function:* Tell them exactly how to verify and take action.
*   *Placeholder to Fill:* (E.g., "I'm third-party tested so you know the dose is real. Check my label right here.")

## 5. Required Publisher Output & Logging
*Since the goal is to formalize this into an agentic workflow later, we must log your manual process.*

**After creation, the publisher must log the following:**
1.  **Time to Create**: How long did it take to move from this document to a finished video?
2.  **Creative Friction**: Which part of this script was hardest to visually execute?
3.  **Hook Variations**: Did you record multiple hooks? If so, list them.
4.  **Length & Word Count**: Final video duration and exact word count used.
