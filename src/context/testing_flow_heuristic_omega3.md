# Anthropos Network Testing Flow Nr. 1: Omega-3 Heuristic Pilot
*Designed for aNet Publisher Execution (Heuristic First Iteration)*

## 1. Operating Principle: Heuristic Validation First
* **The Law of Empirical Validation (1.1)**: "Internal opinions are mere hypotheses; customer behavior is the only valid experiment result." 
* **The Law of Validation Precedence (1.5)**: Before we formalize a perfect agentic workflow, we must run a small-scale, human-led simulation.
* **The Goal**: This is a heuristic test. You (the publisher) will build the video organically using the parameters below. We will log the results, identify the breaking points, and *then* map the successful elements back to the rigid `logic.md` agentic frameworks.

## 2. Word Count Constraints (The Physics of Pacing)
*To prevent cognitive overload and maintain the correct persona stance, we must strictly adhere to verified word counts for short-form pacing.*

*   **Slow & Emotive (60 words)**: Best for building trust or explaining complex ideas.
*   **Medium & Conversational (75 words)**: *The "Golden Rule"* for standard explainer videos or casual social content. **(We are targeting this for our Pilot).**
*   **Fast & Energetic (80–85 words)**: Ideal for high-energy ads or hard sells (Do not use this for the Bottle Persona).

## 3. The Narrative Angle (The Single Deep-Dive)
*   **The Strategic Pivot**: Instead of listing 3 generic benefits (which triggers "listicle reactance" and analysis paralysis), we are going deep on ONE profound biological mechanism.
*   **The Core Thesis**: "If you start taking Me (Omega-3), one massive biological shift dictates everything else: your cells speed up."
*   **The Educated Mechanism**: You are explaining that Omega-3 works by fixing "slow," rigid cells. This is a structural upgrade, not a generic "boost".

## 4. The 75-Word Script Architecture (Medium & Conversational)

*This script is precisely engineered to hit the 75-word conversational constraint while executing the Single Deep-Dive.*

### A. The Hook (15 words) 
*   **Vibe**: The Single Singularity.
*   **Voice**: *"If you start taking Omega-3 today, one massive biological shift dictates everything else."*

### B. The Deep-Dive Mechanism (40 words)
*   **Vibe**: Educated, objective, revealing the hidden truth of "Rigid Cells."
*   **Voice**: *"Your cells literally speed up. Without enough EPA and DHA, your cell membranes harden. They become slow and rigid. When you take high-quality oil, you replace those rigid walls with fluid ones, so your brain finally fires signals normally."*

### C. The CTA & The Moat (20 words)
*   **Vibe**: The heuristic trap for competitors + Institutional Proof.
*   **Voice**: *"But only if the EPA and DHA numbers are high enough. Flip your bottle. I'm third-party tested. Check my label."*

## 5. Required Publisher Output & Logging
*Since the goal is to formalize this into an agentic workflow later, we must log your manual process.*

**After creation, the publisher must log the following:**
1.  **Time to Create**: How long did it take to move from this document to a finished video?
2.  **Creative Friction**: Which part of this script was hardest to visually execute?
3.  **Hook Variations**: Did you record multiple hooks? If so, list them.
4.  **Length & Word Count**: Final video duration and exact word count used.
