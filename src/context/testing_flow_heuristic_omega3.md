# Anthropos Network Testing Flow Nr. 1: Omega-3 Heuristic Pilot
*Designed for aNet Publisher Execution (Heuristic First Iteration)*

## 1. Operating Principle: Heuristic Validation First
* **The Law of Empirical Validation (1.1)**: "Internal opinions are mere hypotheses; customer behavior is the only valid experiment result." 
* **The Law of Validation Precedence (1.5)**: Before we formalize a perfect agentic workflow, we must run a small-scale, human-led simulation.
* **The Goal**: This is a heuristic test. You (the publisher) will build the video organically using the parameters below. We will log the results, identify the breaking points, and *then* map the successful elements back to the rigid `logic.md` agentic frameworks.

## 2. Word Count Constraints (The Physics of Pacing)
*To prevent cognitive overload and maintain the correct persona stance, we must strictly adhere to verified word counts for short-form pacing.*

*   **Slow & Emotive (60 words)**: Best for building trust or explaining complex ideas.
*   **Medium & Conversational (75 words)**: *The "Golden Rule"* for standard explainer videos or casual social content. **(We are targeting this for our Pilot).**
*   **Fast & Energetic (80–85 words)**: Ideal for high-energy ads or hard sells (Do not use this for the Bottle Persona).

---

## 3. The Narrative Angle (The Single Deep-Dive)
*   **The Strategic Pivot**: Instead of listing 3 generic benefits (which triggers "listicle reactance" and analysis paralysis), we are going deep on ONE profound biological mechanism.
*   **The Core Thesis**: "If you start taking Me (Omega-3), one massive biological shift dictates everything else: your cells speed up."
*   **The Educated Mechanism**: You are explaining that Omega-3 works by fixing "slow," rigid cells. This is a structural upgrade, not a generic "boost".

## 4. The "Mechanism-to-Benefit" Causal Chain (Script Structure)
*Use this logical architecture to build out the body of your script. It maps the journey from a microscopic mechanism to a macroscopic daily benefit.*

1. Hook: I make up 40% of your brain. Here’s what I’d do if you ate more of me.
2. Micro-Action: First I’d go to your cells, and because I have high EPA and DHA, I would make them more fluid.
3. Translation: This would turn your neural pathways into high-speed lanes. Your thinking would become faster and deeper. Your mitochondria - the energy generators - would start making more energy with less effort, reducing that afternoon crash and your dopamine - it would become more stable - ending those sugary cravings or doomscrolling. 
5. CTA: Here are all hte facts about me - buy me at Anthroposcity.com/shop

Shorter version:
"I make up 40% of your brain. Here’s what I’d do if you ate me:

First, my high EPA and DHA makes your cells fluid. Your neural pathways become high-speed lanes, making your thinking faster.

Then, your mitochondria generate more energy with less effort, killing that afternoon crash.

Finally, your dopamine stabilizes, ending those sugary cravings and doomscrolling.

### 📱 Layer-1 Optimized Script Execution Map
*(Target Runtime: ~25s | Word Count: 66 | Format: 9:16 Vertical)*

**Scene 1: The Hook Window (0–5s)**
*   *Layer 1 Constraint:* Major persuasive energy by 0-6s. No slow intro. Core proposition visibly text by ≤3s.
*   **Visual/Action:** Extreme close-up of the bottle, dynamic movement (e.g., dropping into frame). 
*   **On-Screen Text (0s):** "I make up 40% of your brain."
*   **Voiceover:** *"I make up 40% of your brain. Here’s what I’d do if you ate me:"*

**Scene 2: Rapid Proof 1 - Neural Speed (5–12s)**
*   *Layer 1 Constraint:* Pattern interrupt/scene variation every 3-5 seconds. 1 core idea per 5s.
*   **Visual/Action:** Jump cut to a new angle or background. Publisher physically points to the label.
*   **On-Screen Text (5s):** "High EPA/DHA = Fluid Cells"
*   **Voiceover:** *"First, my high EPA and DHA makes your cells fluid. Your neural pathways become high-speed lanes, making your thinking faster."*

**Scene 3: Rapid Proof 2 - The Energy Baseline (12–18s)**
*   *Layer 1 Constraint:* Scene variation. Visual proof/mechanism.
*   **Visual/Action:** Fast jump cut to pouring capsules into hand or shaking the bottle near the camera.
*   **On-Screen Text (12s):** "Kills the 3 PM Crash"
*   **Voiceover:** *"Then, your mitochondria generate more energy with less effort, killing that afternoon crash."*

**Scene 4: Rapid Proof 3 - Dopamine Stability (18–22s)**
*   *Layer 1 Constraint:* 1 core idea max per 5s limit.
*   **Visual/Action:** Another jump cut. Publisher holding bottle confidently.
*   **On-Screen Text (18s):** "Stops Sugar Cravings"
*   **Voiceover:** *"Finally, your dopamine stabilizes, ending those sugary cravings and doomscrolling."*

**Scene 5: The Close/CTA (22–26s)**
*   *Layer 1 Constraint:* Explicit CTA in final 20-30%. Voiceover + Written Offer pairing required.
*   **Visual/Action:** Freeze or slow push-in on the bottle. High contrast.
*   **On-Screen Text (22s):** "Get Clinical-Grade ➡️ AnthroposCity.com/shop"
*   **Voiceover:** *"Get my clinical-grade formula at AnthroposCity.com/shop."*

## 5. Required Publisher Output & Logging
*Since the goal is to formalize this into an agentic workflow later, we must log your manual process.*

**After creation, the publisher must log the following:**
1.  **Time to Create**: How long did it take to move from this document to a finished video?
2.  **Creative Friction**: Which part of this script was hardest to visually execute?
3.  **Hook Variations**: Did you record multiple hooks? If so, list them.
4.  **Length & Word Count**: Final video duration and exact word count used.
