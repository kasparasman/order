Do we do the promo codes for ambassador specific tracking

I found a video analyzer AI tool

New logic for algorithm: Ranking of ambassadors - Views/retention% 

Chicken and egg problem:

Create pull in supply side first which is easier to get

Connectors - Sales department

Automated recruiting with AI

Supply first demand later logic?

Our application of this chicken and egg:

We are offering a network for creators becuase it’s better then doing solo. 

Network alreayd needs creators inside, but to get creators inside we already need to have some inside. So therefore we get supply/demand issue. braintrust proved that getting supply first with good offer is easier and then they proved that the main concept works(the network per se that creates trends in tt/IG) on themselves using the supply they gathered adn then used this proof to get demand/clients - which in our case is more creators/ further on brands that pay us to do marketing for them/create a trend for their product. 

The way we solve this:

Set a flip point where the creators we get can create trends -

How do we prove the concept per se?

Do we do marketing for the network itself? do we prove this network concept through marketign this network itself, even though we already have a product shop affiliated with the amazon. But one creator registering is gonna bring 20 dollars directly to ACT as purchase which equals: 400 sales on amazon. 

So could it be even better to just launch straight up marketing of the network itself to gather enough creators and eveyrbody would get a lot of profit from that and once we hit a flip point then we transition to marketing our ANthropos shop? do we split this like hustlers university split?

Marketing: influencers like moltbook or viral organic

Early users buy insane leverage instead of immediate network - later users get network itself and faster trend results from it.  

What do we need to launch the whole thing asap - have the order brief system in place asap

-I commence on it:

# ANTHROPOS DENSE LAUNCH STRATEGY

*(Phase A → Phase B transition engineered)*

This is not a “launch to the public.”

This is a **controlled ignition of a network effect**.

---

## 1. Launch Objective (one sentence, fixed)

> **Create enough coordinated creator output in a narrow domain that TikTok/Instagram algorithms treat Anthropos content as a trend, not individual posts.**
> 

Everything else is secondary.

---

## 2. Launch Philosophy (non-negotiable)

- We do **not** launch wide.
- We do **not** sell income.
- We do **not** promise outcomes.
- We sell **early position inside a forming trend engine**.

If someone needs convincing, they are excluded.

---

## 3. The Launch Shape: “Dense Core, Not Broad Reach”

You are not launching like a SaaS.

You are launching like:

- Facebook on one campus
- Tinder in one social circle
- Early TikTok houses
- Braintrust’s talent pool

### Core rule:

> **Density beats scale.**
> 

---

## 4. Phase A — Internal Density Seeding (Days 1–7)

### Objective

Manufacture the *appearance* and *reality* of coordinated output **before** inviting outsiders.

### Actions

**A. Pick ONE vertical**

- One product category
- One narrative domain
- One type of video format

Examples (pick one):

- health optimization
- cognitive performance
- physical recovery
- sleep / supplements

No switching for 14 days.

---

**B. Founder & Core Node Flood**

You + partner(s) act as **10–15 creators**.

- 2–3 videos per day per person
- Same product family
- Same CTA domain
- Slightly varied hooks

This is intentional **content clustering**.

Platforms don’t care *who* posts — they care about **pattern frequency**.

---

**C. Visual Cohesion (important)**

Not branding — *recognizability*.

- similar captions
- similar structure
- similar framing language

This teaches the algorithm:

> “This is a thing.”
> 

---

## 5. Phase B — Pilot Infiltration (Days 5–14)

### Objective

Inject real creators **into an already moving system**.

Never invite pilots into an empty room.

---

### Who You Recruit (strict filter)

Only creators who:

- already post regularly
- understand algorithms
- are under-monetized
- care about being early

Reject:

- freelancers asking about pay
- skeptics asking for proof
- people who need onboarding

---

### How You Invite (critical framing)

You do NOT pitch “join a platform.”

You pitch:

> **“Join a coordinated output experiment that is already forming a trend.”**
> 

The implication is:

- this is happening with or without them,
- joining now gives position.

---

### Pilot Cap (hard)

- First batch: **10 creators**
- Second batch: **20 creators**
- Third batch: **20 creators**

You do **not** open the gates.

Scarcity is structural, not marketing fluff.

---

## 6. Pilot Rules (this preserves quality)

Every pilot agrees to:

- post within a fixed window
- use the provided brief
- not freestyle narratives
- not promote unrelated content

This is how you preserve **signal coherence**.

Facebook did this socially.

You do it structurally.

---

## 7. Phase C — Algorithmic Ignition (Flip Attempt)

This is the **make-or-break window**.

### What you do here

- Coordinate posting windows (24–72h bursts)
- Push similar content at similar times
- Encourage pilots to comment on each other (not spam, relevance)

This creates:

- correlated engagement
- shared discovery paths
- accelerated distribution

---

### What you watch for (flip signals)

You don’t wait for revenue.

You watch for:

- creators saying “this post did better than usual”
- similar comments appearing across accounts
- content being shown to non-followers
- sudden increases in saves/shares

Once **2–3 creators report this**, you’ve flipped.

---

## 8. Phase D — Narrative Flip (Post-Flip Marketing)

Only after flip signals appear do you change the story.

### Messaging changes from:

> “Position yourself early”
> 

To:

> **“The network amplifies you.”**
> 

Now you are allowed to:

- talk about money
- show early sales
- reference ACT mechanics
- discuss long-term upside

Before this, doing so kills credibility.

---

## 9. Expansion Strategy (After Flip)

Now you can:

- increase creator intake
- loosen constraints gradually
- introduce leaderboard / metrics
- prep brand plug-in roadmap

This is where:

- external brands become interested
- Shopify-like integration makes sense
- ACT becomes an index, not a belief

---

## 10. Why This Works (summary)

This strategy:

- avoids the chicken-and-egg trap
- avoids income comparison early
- manufactures proof instead of claiming it
- aligns with how platforms *actually* form

You are not asking the market to believe.

You are forcing reality to demonstrate.

---

## 11. The One Rule You Must Never Break

> **Never invite someone into a network that is not already moving.**
> 

If the room feels empty, *you* fill it first.
