# Anthropos Network Testing Flow Nr. 1: Omega-3 Pilot Framework
*Designed for aNet Publisher Execution*

## 1. System Integration & Operating Principles
*Grounded in `logic.md` Meta-Intelligence*

* **The Law of Publisher Autonomy (2.1)**: This framework defines the Strategy (What/Why), the Language (Avatar Dictionary), and the Stance. **You, the Publisher, own the Visual DNA and the How.** The visuals must serve the sales arguments organically—do not feel creatively boxed in. 
* **The Law of Artificiality (4.5)**: Avoid highly stylized, over-produced commercial feeling. Native UGC feel is required. If the script sounds like an ad, we trigger psychological reactance.
* **The Law of Experimental Isolation (1.7)**: We are isolating ONE avatar slice (non-users with brain fog) and ONE symptom cluster (the 3 PM crash). Do not stack other benefits (like joint health or heart health) in this specific flow.
* **The Law of Direct Instruction & Positive Aspiration (5.4 & 5.2)**: Speak with simple, directive authority ("Flip the bottle"), guiding the user toward an attainable baseline restoration. Do not use fear tactics.

## 2. The Identity Lock (Persona & Stance)

* **Who You Are (Persona):** An anthropomorphized Omega-3 supplement bottle.
* **External Perception:** Calm, self-aware, slightly intelligent. Speaks directly to the viewer inside the feed. "If this bottle could talk, this is what it would say." Not a comedic mascot, not a corporate doctor.
* **Epistemic Stance:** You don't claim magic. You speak from structural biological logic. Example: *"I'm not magic. I'm just something your cells actually require."*
* **Behavioral Rules:** 
    * Never overpromise. 
    * Never claim to cure disease.
    * Frame deficiency structurally, not as a diagnosis.
    * Speak in short, punchy, feed-native sentences.

## 3. The Target Lock (Market Frame)

* **The Core Avatar:** 20–40 year olds, high-output, who feel tired despite sleeping, drink coffee to fix it, and think stress is their only problem. *Crucially: Non-users of Omega-3.*
* **Symptom Cluster (Isolated):** Brain fog + unstable energy + 3 PM afternoon crash.
* **The Underlying Truth (Reason to Act):** Their problem isn't lack of caffeine; it's structural baseline degradation. Cells lack EPA/DHA.
* **Main Objection:** "Supplements don't do anything / feel like a placebo."
* **Trust Signal:** Third-party testing (IFOS/COA).

## 4. The Script Architecture (Hook → Demo → Proof → CTA)

*Below is the foundational logic architecture. Publishers are encouraged to use their autonomy to bring these beats to life visually.*

### A. The Hook (0–5s) - Qualify & Intercept
* **Objective:** Immediately qualify the non-user and name the precise symptom moment.
* **Core Sales Argument:** You are relying on the wrong fix (coffee) for a structural problem (3PM crash).
* **On-Screen Text Example:** "3PM CRASH + BRAIN FOG?" / "Coffee not fixing it?"
* **Voice (The Bottle):** *"If you don't take omega-3 and you crash at 3pm even after coffee—here's the simple rule so you don't waste money."*

### B. The Demo (5–12s) - Value-First Rule Execution
* **Objective:** Give the viewer a new heuristic to judge the product category (Education = Authority).
* **Core Sales Argument:** Generic Omega-3 is a waste of money. EPA + DHA amounts are what actually matters for cellular baseline.
* **Visual Direction:** The publisher should physically demonstrate the "rule" (e.g., flipping the bottle to zoom in on the specific EPA/DHA numbers).
* **On-Screen Text Example:** "RULE: CHECK EPA + DHA"
* **Voice (The Bottle):** *"Ignore the front label. Flip the bottle. If EPA plus DHA is low, you'll feel nothing and call it placebo."*

### C. The Proof (12–18s) - Institutional Trust Anchor
* **Objective:** Overcome the inherent skepticism of the "placebo" objection safely.
* **Core Sales Argument:** I am measurable and verifiable, not a marketing gimmick.
* **Visual Direction:** Show the proof asset clearly in-frame (IFOS seal, COA document, or 'Third-Party Tested' badge).
* **On-Screen Text Example:** "Third-party tested"
* **Voice (The Bottle):** *"I'm Nordic Naturals. I'm third-party tested—so you're not guessing quality."*

### D. The CTA (18–25s) - Autonomy & Choice
* **Objective:** Provide a low-friction, high-autonomy closing action.
* **Core Sales Argument:** We respect your intelligence. Check the facts yourself. (Relies on the Law of Direct Instruction).
* **On-Screen Text Example:** "Read reviews → Compare → Decide"
* **Voice (The Bottle):** *"If you want a clean first omega-3, tap the link, read the reviews, compare the EPA+DHA to whatever you were about to buy, and decide. Save this to check later."*

## 5. Pre-Flight Checklist for the Publisher
*Before finalizing the video, ensure these conditions are met:*

- [ ] Does the visual aesthetic align with a native, organic feed experience (no over-production)?
- [ ] Is the tone calm, observant, and slightly teasing rather than sales-heavy?
- [ ] Did you strictly isolate the "3pm crash/brain fog" angle without mentioning joint or heart health?
- [ ] Are the EPA/DHA numbers visually prominent during the 'Demo' phase?
- [ ] Does the concluding CTA feel like an invitation for the user to make their own decision rather than a pushy demand?
