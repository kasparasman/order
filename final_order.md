# FIELD MANUAL: NORDIC NATURALS ULTIMATE OMEGA

## 1. THE SETUP
**The Belief Install & Mechanism**

Director, we aren't selling a "vitamin." We are selling an exit strategy from a life lived at 70% capacity. Most people think their brain fog and midday "slump" are just part of getting older. They aren’t. It’s internal friction caused by a modern diet that’s high in inflammatory oils and low in the "coolant" their cells actually need.

**The Mechanism: The Cellular Software Update**
Think of the viewer’s brain and heart like a high-performance computer running on glitchy, outdated software. Chronic inflammation is the background lag. Nordic Naturals doesn't "boost" the system; it performs a **Cellular Software Update**. By delivering a massive 1280mg dose of pure, stable EPA and DHA, we are physically swapping out the rigid, "glitchy" fats in their cell membranes for fluid, high-speed ones. 

**Directives for the Screen:**
*   **Clear the Mud:** Position the product as the tool that clears the "mental wall" coffee can't touch.
*   **The Tipping Point:** Use the 1280mg dose as the evidence. Most fish oils are "squirt guns at a house fire." This is the fire hose.
*   **The Anchor:** Frame the lemon-flavored soft gel as a simple, high-reward ritual—not a "medical regimen."

## 2. THE VIEWER
**Their Story & Skepticism**

**The Story: The Slow Leak**
Your viewer wakes up feeling like they didn’t quite "finish" sleeping. By 11:00 AM, the mental static kicks in. They are "wired and tired"—brittle mood, slow recovery, and a general sense of being "off-balance." They’ve accepted this as their new normal.

**The Skepticism: "Fish Oil Fatigue"**
They have a dusty bottle of generic fish oil in their cabinet right now. They think they’ve "tried Omega-3s" and they "don't work." They’re right—the cheap stuff they bought was likely under-dosed, oxidized (rancid), or poorly absorbed. 

**The Pivot:**
You have to call out this "Fish Oil Trauma" directly. Tell them: *"The reason you didn’t feel it before is that you weren't giving your cells enough to work with. You don't need a miracle; you need a dose that actually reaches the threshold of change."*

## 3. THE SCRIPT SKELETON
**The Before → Mechanism → After → CTA**

**PHASE 1: THE HOOK (0–6s)**
*   **Visual:** "The Fog Shatter." Start with a slightly blurred/static filter that snaps into 4K clarity the moment the 1280mg callout hits the screen.
*   **VO:** "You aren't actually tired. Your brain is just wading through a wall of internal inflammation that coffee can't touch."

**PHASE 2: THE BODY (6–20s)**
*   **Visual:** Macro shot of the golden-amber soft gel. Transition to a quick 3D graphic of a jagged cell membrane turning supple and glowing.
*   **VO:** "Think of this as a Cellular Software Update. At 1280mg of pure EPA and DHA, we’re physically swapping out glitchy cell fats for high-speed fluidity. If your current oil isn't hitting this dose and passing 3rd-party purity tests, your cells aren't even listening."

**PHASE 3: THE CLOSE (20–30s)**
*   **Visual:** A "Quiet Confidence" shot—a clean workspace or a calm morning. Zoom in on the 120-count bottle (the 60-day supply) on a kitchen counter.
*   **VO:** "Upgrade your cellular baseline. Secure your 120-count bottle of Ultimate Omega today and start your 60-day protocol."
*   **Text Overlay:** [BOTTLE IMAGE] + **REBOOT YOUR BRAIN. 1280MG OMEGA-3. SHOP NOW.**

## 4. THE LAWS OF CONVERSION
**The Physics of the Feed**

*   **Law 1: The 3-Second Rescue.** The thumb moves faster than the mind. Show the product and the "1280mg" text by second 3. We aren't building suspense; we are providing a rescue.
*   **Law 2: The 5-Second Beat.** Reset the viewer’s attention clock every 5 seconds. Shift from the bottle → to the golden gel → to the cell graphic → to the high-performer. Avoid static environments.
*   **Law 3: The 7-Second Anchor.** 80% of people watch on silent. Clear, bold text stating "1280mg Potency" must be on-screen by second 7 so they know *exactly* what this is without the volume.
*   **Law 4: The Non-Linear Test.** Assume the viewer scrolls in at second 5. Does the frame still make sense? Keep a persistent "1280mg Omega-3" watermark or label visible throughout the body.

## 5. CREATIVE AUTONOMY ZONE
**Visual Texture & Vibe**

*   **The "Spotlight Sequence":** Don't clog the screen with all the labels at once. Have the benefits (Heart, Brain, Immune) "pulse" individually in sync with the VO. Lead the eye; don't overwhelm it.
*   **Sonic Transitions:** Use "digital sweeps" or "system chimes" when showing the cellular update. We want the video to *sound* like a reboot.
*   **Texture Contrast:** Mix your "Studio Science" (4K macro gels, 3D graphics) with "Daily Reality" (a hand opening the bottle in natural morning light). This proves it’s a lab-grade tool that fits in a real kitchen.
*   **The Lemon Cue:** Don't waste time talking about taste. Use a quick yellow light flare or a splash of water/lemon visual. This handles the "fishy taste" objection subconsciously.
*   **The Ritual Close:** Show the 120-count bottle being placed next to a morning planner or a glass of water. Frame it as the "Anchor" of their new baseline.

**Director's Note:** Keep it moving. The edit should feel as fluid as the product promises. If a shot feels long, cut it. **Now, go build the machine.**
